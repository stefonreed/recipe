        <p>Great staff we were lucky they took our order at 12.15 while closing as we were searching to have something sweet after heavy diet at delhi darbar 
.We ordered belgain choclate with extra nutella extra filling .We were dissapointed that the same was reflecting on our bill but not on our waffle which managment needs to address. Overall the place is good and the waffle was great too.
